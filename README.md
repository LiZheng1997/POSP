# POSP
This is a project for picking out the packages when there are parallel packages. Normal situation is that two packages are closing to each other, some difficult situation is that one package will be too close to the other one or two packages.

**POSP** means Pick Out Single Package, this project aims at solving the problem of parallel packages transporting on a conveyor belt. Like the video shows below:
